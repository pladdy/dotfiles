### dotfiles
My super sweet dotfiles!  Never leave home without them and always happy to share!

### Dependencies
All of this was set up on and for mac os.  Some assumpions and/or things I need/use:
Use `brew` for dependencies:
- `brew install vim`
- `brew install hub`

### Installation
`./install`

This will backup current dotfilesin your home directory and then create
symlinks to the repo dotfiles.

### VIM
`./vim_setup`

This will install plugins to get the vim environment all setup.
